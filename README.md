# NLP Tutorials with PyTorch

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tutorials based on the book **"Getting Started with Deep Learning Using PyTorch"** published on [Wikidocs](https://wikidocs.net/book/2788). All tutorials are implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Tutorials

Theoretical explanations and foundations of the code are covered extensively in a free e-book, which spans approximately 950 pages. If you're interested in the concepts behind the code or wish to deepen your understanding, please refer to the e-book below:

## ðŸ”¬ Colab Notebooks for Practice

For hands-on practice, each `.py` tutorial script includes a link to a corresponding Google Colab notebook. These `.py` files are automatically converted from `.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) files for easier code sharing.

To run the tutorials without any local Python installation:

1. Open the `.py` file.
2. Click the Colab link provided at the top.
3. The notebook will open in your browser (preferably Chrome), where you can run it directly.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Although you can run the notebooks in Colab without installing anything, if you wish to run the code locally, make sure to install:

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running `.ipynb` files)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each directory or file in this repository represents an individual tutorial, covering a specific NLP topic or model, including but not limited to:

* Text classification
* Sentiment analysis
* Word embeddings
* RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers
* Language modeling
